# Simple implementations of common (bio)informatics algorithms

Simple implementations of random (bio)informatics-related algorithms, analyses and projects I come across in my studies.
Most of it will be in Python, some of the more complex algorithms and projects will be in Java or C++.
Feel free to use any of my scripts if you feel like they might be of use to you.
