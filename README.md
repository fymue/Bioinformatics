# (Bio)informatics-related algorithms/projects

Simple implementations of random (bio)informatics-related algorithms and projects I come across in my studies or simply feel like coding.
Most of it will be in Python or Java, but I also want to try some other languages in the future.
Feel free to use any of my code if you feel like it might be of use to you.
